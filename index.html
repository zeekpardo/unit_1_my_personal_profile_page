        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate front-end developer in training, driven by a love for creating efficient systems and problem-solving with software. My journey in this field is fueled by my experiences in previous roles, where I was naturally drawn to enhancing productivity through software solutions and custom tool creation. This path has led me to a focused pursuit in front-end development.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am dedicated to mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through a project-based course. This is a significant step towards my ultimate goal of becoming a full-stack developer. I am particularly excited about applying my developing skills in real-world scenarios, starting with building a new website for my church and redesigning an app for my brother.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

As I continue to learn and grow, I am eager to contribute to larger projects and make a meaningful impact in the world of web development.</p>
